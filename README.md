# Hymenshu's Portfolio 👑 | ヒメンシュのポートフォリオ

Welcome to my **backend-dev powered anime-themed portfolio**.  
Built with speed, sarcasm, and stolen code. No frontend feelings were hurt in the making of this site.  
_“If it compiles, it deploys.”_ — Me, 2025

## ⚔️ 技術 (Tech Stack)

- **React.js** – because even sigma devs need a UI
- **Tailwind CSS** – quick styles, no drama
- **Vite** – speed > everything
- **Anime Vibes** – background: Gojo, colors: chaos

## 🌸 Inspiration

This portfolio was inspired by:
- Backend dev frustration 😤
- Anime energy ⚡ (“私は最強!” – *I am the strongest!*)
- The urge to flex without coding the frontend ✌️

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Some projects are mine. Some are not. But I understood the README, so I own them now.
- Built entirely while watching anime and drinking chai. 🍵
